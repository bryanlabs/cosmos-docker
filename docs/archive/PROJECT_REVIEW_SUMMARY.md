- **Proper file permissions** and executable scripts

### ✅ 6. CI/CD Implementation
- **GitHub Actions workflows** for automated testing:
  - YAML linting with proper configuration
  - Docker Compose validation
  - Security scanning with Trivy
  - Environment file validation
  - Makefile target testing
- **Automated quality checks** on every pull request
- **Security monitoring** with scheduled scans

### ✅ 7. Security Enhancements
- **Enhanced .gitignore** to prevent sensitive file commits
- **Security scanning** in CI/CD pipeline
- **Secret detection** in validation scripts
- **Sensitive file pattern checks**
- **Production configuration isolation**

### ✅ 8. Developer Experience

## 🔧 Key Improvements by Category

### Configuration Management
- **Two-tier configuration approach**: Simple (.env.example) and comprehensive (thorchain-1.env)
- **Environment variable substitution**: All hardcoded values replaced with configurable options
- **Clear documentation**: Every configuration option explained with comments
- **Validation**: Automated checks for configuration syntax and completeness

### Docker Best Practices
- **YAML anchors**: Reduced duplication in Docker Compose configuration
- **Health checks**: Proper service health monitoring
- **Resource management**: Appropriate volume and network configurations
- **Development support**: Separate development configuration for easier debugging

### Automation & Tooling
- **Comprehensive validation**: Pre-deployment checks for all components
- **CI/CD pipeline**: Automated testing and security scanning
- **Enhanced Makefile**: Better target organization and error handling
